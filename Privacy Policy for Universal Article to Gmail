Privacy Policy for Universal Article to Gmail

Universal Article to Gmail does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.
All data processing occurs locally within your browser. The extension does not send any data to external servers.
We do not share or sell user information to any third parties.

Clipboard Permission Justification (clipboardWrite)
-------------------------------------------------
The extension requests the optional `clipboardWrite` permission solely to place the article content you explicitly choose to send into Gmail onto your system clipboard. This occurs only after you click the "Send Article to Gmail" button (a direct user gesture) and is limited to the HTML (or plain text, if you enable the plain text setting) of the currently viewed article plus a source URL reference.

Key Points:
1. Write-Only: The extension never reads or inspects existing clipboard contents; it only writes the new article content.
2. Local-Only: Clipboard data is not transmitted to any remote server or third party; all operations remain within your browser environment.
3. User-Controlled: You can disable automatic clipboard copying at any time via the side panel Settings (toggle: "Enable automatic clipboard copy"). You can also choose a plain-text-only mode.
4. Purpose: Providing a manual fallback so the user can paste content into Gmail or other editors if automated insertion encounters issues.
5. Scope: No persistent storage of clipboard data; nothing leaves your machine.

If you opt out (toggle off), the permission is effectively unused and no clipboard activity occurs.

Side Panel Permission Justification (sidePanel)
-------------------------------------------------
The extension requests the `sidePanel` permission solely to provide a convenient, persistent configuration interface within Chrome's built-in side panel UI. This allows you to manage site configurations, import/export settings, and adjust preferences without disrupting your browsing workflow.

Key Points:
1. UI-Only: This permission is used exclusively to display the extension's settings interface in Chrome's side panel area; no data collection or transmission occurs.
2. Local Configuration: All settings and site configurations remain in local browser storage; the side panel merely provides a user-friendly interface to view and edit them.
3. User-Controlled: You can open/close the side panel at will by clicking the extension icon or using Chrome's side panel controls.
4. Purpose: Providing a more integrated and accessible settings experience compared to traditional popup windows.
5. No Network Activity: The side panel permission does not grant any network access or data sharing capabilities.
